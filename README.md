Chinese Traditional Music Score Library: A collection of Chinese traditional music notated in staff notation. 


## Overview

Chinese traditional and classical music, known for its profound depth and historical richness, has traditionally been notated in Jianpu (numbered musical notation), which is predominantly used within China. However, this notation style is not widely adopted outside of China, limiting the ability of musicians around the world to engage with and perform Chinese music.

This project aims to bridge this gap by transcribing these traditional Chinese compositions into staff notation using MusicXML, the universal language of music notation recognized globally. By converting these scores into a format accessible to all musicians, regardless of their instrument or location, this initiative seeks to make Chinese music more universally playable and appreciated.

## Goals

- **Transcribe Traditional Chinese Scores**: Convert traditional and classical Chinese music from Jianpu to standard staff notation.
- **Utilize MusicXML Format**: Employ MusicXML to ensure that the scores are easily accessible, editable, and compatible with various music software and platforms.
- **Promote Global Accessibility**: Enable musicians outside of China, as well as those playing non-traditional Chinese instruments, to explore and perform Chinese music.
- **Digital Standardization**: Contribute to the digital preservation and standardization of Chinese music, facilitating its integration into the global music community.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions from musicians, scholars, and enthusiasts. If you're interested in contributing to the transcription process or have access to traditional Chinese scores that you would like to see included in this library, please reach out to us. Detailed guidelines for contributions can be found in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.

## Usage

This library provides scores in two formats: MusicXML and PDF.

- **MusicXML Format**: The MusicXML files are intended for use with music notation software. This format allows musicians to edit, transpose, and personalize the scores according to their needs.

- **PDF Format**: The PDF files are ready-to-use and can be directly used for performance. These are designed for easy printing and are ideal for musicians who wish to use the scores in their traditional form without the need for editing.

Both formats are available for free download and are intended for educational purposes, personal study, and public performance. Please refer to the LICENSE file for more information on the usage rights and restrictions.
